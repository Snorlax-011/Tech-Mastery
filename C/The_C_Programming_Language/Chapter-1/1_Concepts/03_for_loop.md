# For Loop:

# Syntax:
```c
for(initialization; condition; increment)
{   .
    .
    body
    .
    .
}
```

After initialization, the condition will be evaluated and if it's true, the body will be executed.
Then occurs the increment and the condition will be re-evalauated....

The program will exit the loop when the condition isn't met.
