# Character I/O:
C will process all the text inputs to the program as one long line of characters (one by one).

# Input Stream:
The input stream is like a conveyor belt sending characters(one at a time) to the program.

`getchar()` reads the next input character from the stream and returns that value.
`putchar()` prints the contents of a variable(when called) as a character.
