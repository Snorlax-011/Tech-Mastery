# End of File:

> How does C know when the input or a text has ended?
Like...input can be "    " or ' '...(C accepts space characters, tabs, new lines...) and while writing the code we go to new lines (by clicking enter or \n).
Then how does C exactly know whether input/code has ended or the user has printed more spaces?

>> Here comes the value "End of File" with dramatic background effectsðŸ˜ŽðŸ”¥.

`getchar` (and the functions that read the provided data char by char) returns a distinguishable value when the input ends.

This value is called `End of File`.

In programming, we use return values to signal the status.
End of file is one such value.


Now as to why we shouldn't initialize `getchar`() as char in [Character I/O code](../Code/05_char_i_o.c) is because `getchar` might return any value and we must be prepared to declare the function with a type big enough to hold such value. That's why we used int.

A char variable is only guaranteed to be able to hold all possible characters.
An int variable is larger and can hold all possible characters plus the special EOF value

`EOF` is an integer defined in `<stdio.h>`.

The expression `c != EOF` is the standard way a C program checks if the end of the input has been reached.

# Signaling EOF:
Let's try to see the EOF:
Here's eof.c code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    int c;
    c = getchar();
    while(c != EOF)
    {
        c = getchar();
    }
    printf("%d\n", c);
}
```
say, the input is `4321`.
After hitting `4321` and enter in the terminal,
`c` stores `4` (`c = 4`)
Then the `while` loop: `c != EOF`,
so `c` stores next value of the input stream: `3`. Still `c != EOF`...
The while loop goes on... `c = \n` (hitting `enter` adds `\n` to the input stream).
`c` is still `!= EOF`.

>So...the loop waits for more inputs (even if we doesn't enter any input). Just because we stop talking in a phone call doesn't mean the call ends.

So, `c` never equals `EOF` until and unless we "signal `EOF`" for the input stream.

We use `Ctrl + D` to signal `EOF` (in Linux environment).

After hitting `4321 + Enter`, hit `Ctrl + D`.

Only then, the loop ends and `c = EOF`.
Then `printf` prints `-1`on the screen. (In most cases, the value of `EOF` is `-1` (as per my browsing in the internet))
